I created this script for automating the enumeration of finding executables that matches the ones found in the PATH env for further privilege escalation via PATH technique, specifically for tryhackme lab (linux privilege escalation).
just run the script, there are no requirements I used the built in libs.
it needs more enhancement, maybe I'll fine tune the script whenever I find the time.
the python version i was using at the time python 3.11.2.
Example:
python path_env.py
