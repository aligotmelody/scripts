# I created this script for enumerating executables that matches the ones found in the PATH env for further privilege escalation via PATH technique, specifically for tryhackme lab (linux privilege escalation). <br>

just run the script, there are no requirements I used the built in libs. <br>
sorry of it's unreadable I was kinda in a hurry, maybe I'll fine tune the script whenever I find the time. <br>
the python version i was using at the time python 3.11.2 . <br>
## Example:
`python path_env.py`
